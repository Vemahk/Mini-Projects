# Mini-Projects
Just a place where I make a few small programs in my off time.

# Pareto
This is a trading simulation that I heard about recently that I wanted to test out.
With the default settings, 1500 'people' (represented as ints) start with 10 dollars, say. A random indexed person 'a' is chosen, and then receives a random indexed person's 'b' dollar. 'b' cannot be someone with 0 dollars, because you can't lose money you don't have (at least in this sim). What do you think would happen over a very long time?

Well, you can try out this code to see! Controls for the frame are as such: Esc closes the program, Space pauses it, and the UP and DOWN arrow keys speed up and slow down the simulation, respectively.
